{{< figure src="images/matienzo.jpg" type="margin" alt="A woman's head." >}}
I am the **Head of Application Development Services** in the Library IT division of the [UC Berkeley Library](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu), where I manage a team of developers that build and maintain staff- and patron-facing software. We develop our code [in the open](https://github.com/berkeleylibrary) whenever we can. While I have a wide portfolio in my current role, my work and my research involves *interoperability*, *change management*, *metadata aggregation*, *facilitation*, and *archival discovery, delivery, and systems integration.* 

My past work includes engineering management, software development, born-digital archives, and metadata management. I've worked in a variety of roles in both academic and research libraries and industry, and have a long history in open source software and open standards development. 

My name is properly written in *lowercase* in professional settings, with an acute accent over the "i" on my first name. 

I am reachable at <span class="sans">my lastname</span>`@berkeley.edu`.
